usb-c breakout
==============
Simple USB-C breakout to access USB-2 bus lines of a USB-C Connector.

Footprints are provided to add resistors on the CC lines to configure either as source or sink. Soldering wires on the resistor pads access the CC1 and CC2 lines.

Could be used for USB PD experiments.

PCB were done at oshpark by uploading the kicad_pcb directly, that's why there are no gerbers.

The project does not depend on ANY external kicad lib. All required footprints and symbols are available in this repo in a local library.
